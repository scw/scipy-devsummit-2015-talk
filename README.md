Description
-----------
ArcGIS developers build rich tools and applications that help solve a wide variety of real-world problems. In this workshop, learn how to expand your domain of expertise into the world of scientific data analysis. Explore how to ingest, analyze and integrate scientific data into your applications. With the release of 10.3, SciPy will ship with the ArcGIS platform. SciPy is a rich set of Python modules for scientific and technical computing. This session will focus on how you can leverage SciPy to be more efficient, solve challenging scientific problems from within ArcGIS, and build hybrid applications that capitalize on both the strengths of ArcGIS and the Python ecosystem. Using real-world case studies explore best practices and programming patterns for leveraging SciPy.

Building
--------

 - From `slides/`, run `make` to rebuild the slide deck from the included slides.md file. Requires [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).
 - Check links with `make check`, requires [LinkChecker](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/LinkChecker).
 - Generate handout version with `make pdf`. Requires XeTeX and pandoc.
